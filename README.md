## üöÄ Getting Started
Welcome to the Monte-Carlo-Localization project. This application allows you to simulate how a robot navigates using a technique called Monte Carlo Localization (MCL). It uses a ray-casting LIDAR sensor to create a realistic environment, making it an excellent educational tool for anyone interested in robotics.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites
Before you download the software, ensure your computer meets the following requirements:

- **Operating System:** Windows 10 or newer, macOS 10.14 or newer, or a modern Linux distribution.
- **RAM:** At least 4 GB of memory.
- **Processor:** Dual-core processor or better.
- **Graphics:** A graphics card that supports OpenGL 2.1 or newer.

6. **Explore the Features:**
   After launching, you can begin by experimenting with various simulation settings. The user interface is designed to be intuitive, making it easy for you to adjust parameters and observe the robot's movements.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
Monte-Carlo Localization helps robots determine their position using sensor data. The application employs particles to estimate the robot's location based on the input from the LIDAR sensor. Here's a brief overview of its key features:

- **Ray-Casting LIDAR Simulation:** Simulates a LIDAR sensor that emits beams to detect obstacles.
- **Probabilistic Localization:** Uses probabilistic methods to improve the accuracy of localization over time.
- **Interactive User Interface:** Allows users to interact with the simulation easily, modifying variables to see different outcomes.
- **Visualization Tools:** Offers graphical representations of the robot's estimated path and obstacles detected.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
1. **Detailed Simulation Environment:**
   You can set up various environments incorporating obstacles, allowing the robot to navigate complex scenarios.

2. **Customization Options:**
   Adjust particle numbers, sensor noise, and other parameters to see how they affect localization.

3. **Educational Resources:**
   The application includes links to tutorials and documentation, helping you understand the underlying principles of MCL and robotic navigation.

4. **Open Source:**
   As an open-source project, you can view the source code or contribute to its development. This is a great opportunity to learn more about programming and robotics.
