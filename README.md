# MCL & RayCasting â€“ 2D Robot Localization Simulator (C++/SFML)

A lightweight simulator of **Monte Carlo Localization (MCL)** with **LIDAR-style ray casting** in a 2D world.  
Built in modern C++ and SFML, itâ€™s designed for **experimentation**, **teaching**, and **rapid prototyping** of probabilistic robotics.

> **Core idea:** given noisy odometry and range measurements, maintain a cloud of weighted particles to estimate robot pose in a known map.  
> We simulate the range sensor via GPU-friendly ray casting.

##  Features

- Particle Filter (**MCL**) with motion + measurement update and resampling  
- Fast **ray casting** against line-segment obstacles (LIDAR emulation)  
- **Interactive visualization** in SFML: robot, particles, rays, obstacles  
- Deterministic and stochastic runs (seed control)  
- Configurable FOV, range, particle count, step sizes  
- Extensible modular code: `Environment`, `Robot`, `Particle`, `main loop`
